                        As a startup company, I voluntarily took the initiative to develop a C# program which reads exported .csv files containing comprehensive data on glass furnace production within our department. Leveraging this stored information, the program accurately determines optimal processing times for furnace loads based on historical data. If a load is delayed beyond the expected output time, the program promptly highlights it, presenting missed load information in text format alongside the total count of missed loads for the production day.
			Additionally, I incorporated a manually configurable delay feature, allowing loads that are missed by a duration shorter than the set delay to not be categorized as missed loads. In a subsequent version, I enhanced the program by integrating a total timer. This feature meticulously tracks the cumulative time lost due to missed loads, providing valuable insights for process optimization.
			Although initially designed as a temporary solution until an official system could be implemented, this program significantly improved efficiency in our production processes.

	                        Over the years, numerous methods of inputting information into computer systems have been
				developed, and for many decades, keyboards have been a staple and often overlooked input device.
				As one of the primary input devices, keyboards have become indispensable in the infrastructure of
				modern computing systems.
                	</p>
			<p>
				When a key on the keyboard is pressed, not only is the corresponding command input into the
				computer, but the key generates a unique auditory signature that is distinct and identifiable from its
				counterparts, this unique auditory signature opens a dangerous vulnerability through side channel
				attacks. Such attacks exploit the information leakage, in this instance sound, to gain insight into
				otherwise secure processes. By analyzing the auditory signature produced by the different keys
				on the keyboard, adversaries can employ machine learning algorithms to infer the keystrokes of an
				unsuspecting user. This method of eavesdropping is particularly worrisome in contexts where
				sensitive information, such as passwords or personal data are being typed [4], which is a threat to
				privacy and security. This risk not only affects individual users, but also organisations that depend
				on keyboards for daily operations.
			</p>    
			<p>   
				The aim of this dissertation is to investigate and determine the extent to which keypresses,
				specifically the letters of the alphabet (A-Z) on a QWERTY layout blue-switch mechanical keyboard,
				can be accurately identified using machine learning techniques. This research will utilize two
				different audio recording devices and examine different typing styles from various participants to
				capture a wide range of auditory signatures. By studying these signatures under different recording
				environments, this dissertation aims to assess the vulnerability of keyboard input data against
				acoustic side channel attacks, determining the potential for unauthorized deciphering of typed
				information. 
                	</p>
			<p>
				The results from this process showed that under ideal environmental conditions within a controlled
				environment, the two classification algorithms were able to achieve high levels of accuracy when
				trying to identify the specific letter that was pressed based on the characteristics of the audio
				signatures. While under sub-optimal conditions within noisy environments, the two classification
				algorithms were only able to achieve low classification accuracies.
			</p>    
			<p>    
				In one configuration, a sample taken from the sanitary dataset of 20 pangrams was 100% accurate,
				while the average of the entire dataset was 88.61% accurate. While a sample taken from the dirty
				dataset of 20 pangrams, the highest accuracy was 25%, while the average of the entire dataset was
				16.27%. These findings prove that the first hypothesis is not valid, specifically, that the keyboard
				audio signatures captured in a quiet and controlled environment are unique enough to accurately
				determine the corresponding letter on the keyboard. 
                	</p>    
			<p>
				As a whole, the research was successful, presenting further questions and many notable
				observations from the process, but ultimately more work is needed to build on these results and
				determine if audio signatures are unique enough to accurately determine the corresponding letter
				on the keyboard to be used in side channel attacks.
