            <p>
                My advanced studies in Cyber Security provided comprehensive knowledge and hands-on experience in key areas, including:
		<br><br>
		        <ul>
		            <li style="margin-left: 30px;"><p><b>Cyber Security:</b> This paper introduced the key topics in the important field of cybersecurity. It covered various aspects of defensive, offensive, and preventative security. Selective topics from a wide range, such as security vulnerabilities, secure software, intrusion detection and prevention, cryptography, applied cryptography, authentication and access control, information security management, etc., were covered.</p></li>
		            <li style="margin-left: 30px;"><p><b>Information Visualization:</b> This paper aimed to raise awareness of the potential offered by information visualization techniques, develop familiarity with the underlying concepts, and foster the understanding and ability to effectively design and apply information visualizations in a given context.</p></li>
		            <li style="margin-left: 30px;"><p><b>Legal Aspects of Cyber Security:</b> This research seminar paper provided an advanced-level examination of critical issues regarding the legal aspects of Cyber Security. Students were to complete a supervised research project of up to 12,500 words. My supervised research project was based on "illicit activities primarily relating to cybercrime on the Dark Web".</p></li>
		            <li style="margin-left: 30px;"><p><b>Cryptography:</b> This paper aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of cryptography by exploring its fundamental principles and examining various cryptographic algorithms. It discussed the applications of these algorithms in securing communication, covered the mathematical foundations of cryptography, and addressed key management practices. Additionally, it included practical exercises for designing and implementing cryptographic solutions in real-world scenarios, while also considering emerging topics in the field.</p></li>
		            <li style="margin-left: 30px;"><p><b>Security for Advanced Networks:</b> Networks have evolved considerable in the last decade, leading to new technologies. Changes in the attack surface make network security a permanent concern. Novel approaches to protect them are required, and these approaches were covered in this paper.</p></li>
		            <li style="margin-left: 30px;"><p><b>Malware Analysis and Penetration Testing:</b> This paper went through two important aspects of Cyber Security. It first covered the defensive security techniques of malware analysis and then examined the offensive security techniques of penetration testing.</p></li>
		            <li style="margin-left: 30px;"><p><b>Secure Cloud Application Engineering:</b> Software Engineering on the Cloud is extremely prevalent nowadays. In this paper, we learned how to design, develop, and test cloud-native applications with a special focus on satisfying business requirements.</p></li>
		            <li style="margin-left: 30px;"><p><b>Dissertation:</b> Using machine learning to identify keyboard keystrokes based on sound is a novel approach in cybersecurity research. It contributes to understanding and mitigating acoustic side-channel attacks by analyzing subtle sound variations generated by keystrokes. This method aims to uncover vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors seeking unauthorized access to sensitive information. By correlating acoustic signals with specific keyboard inputs, we can develop more robust defense mechanisms against these types of attacks.</p></li>
		        </ul>
	    </p>
		<p style="margin-top: 25px;">
			My studies also covered key frameworks and standards critical to cyber security:
			<br><br>
		</p>
		<p>
			<ul>
		            <li style="margin-left: 30px;"><p><b>NIST Guidelines:</b> We explored the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidelines for managing and reducing cybersecurity risks, including the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, which helps organizations identify, protect, detect, respond to, and recover from cyber threats.</p></li>
		            <li style="margin-left: 30px;"><p><b>OWASP:</b> The course included an in-depth look at the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), particularly the OWASP Top 10, which highlights the ten most critical web application security risks. This resource is essential for understanding and mitigating common vulnerabilities in web applications.</p></li>
		            <li style="margin-left: 30px;"><p><b>MITRE ATT&CK Framework:</b> We examined the MITRE ATT&CK Framework, a comprehensive knowledge base that details adversary tactics and techniques. This framework aids in understanding, detecting, and defending against cyber threats by providing insights into attacker behavior.</p></li>
		            <li style="margin-left: 30px;"><p><b>ISO 27001/27002:</b> The course also covered ISO 27001 and ISO 27002, international standards for managing sensitive information and implementing best practices for information security controls. ISO 27001 focuses on the requirements for an Information Security Management System (ISMS), while ISO 27002 provides guidelines for selecting and managing security controls based on an organization's risk environment.</p></li>
		        </ul>
           	</p>
